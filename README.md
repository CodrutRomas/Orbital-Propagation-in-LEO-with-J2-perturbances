# Orbital Propagation with Perturbation (Originally was only LEO and J2 but updated to full scale orbits with more perturbations)
A sophisticated Python implementation of orbital mechanics featuring full-scale orbital propagation from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary (GEO) with comprehensive perturbation modeling and real-time 3D visualization.
## Overview
This project provides a complete orbital mechanics simulation toolkit featuring:

- Full-scale orbital propagation (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, and beyond)
- Comprehensive J2 perturbations
- Advanced atmospheric drag modeling with altitude-dependent density
- Third-body perturbations (Sun and Moon)
- Real-time 3D orbital visualization with temporal gradient trails
- Enhanced ground track mapping with day/night cycle
- Interactive satellite coverage analysis
- High-precision numerical integration with adaptive algorithms![Untitleddesign1-ezgif com-crop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e414ba85-203f-4b0d-86ec-058f9996721e)

## Orbital Elements
- a - Semi-major axis (km)
- e - Eccentricity
- i - Inclination (degrees)
- Ω - RAAN (Right Ascension of Ascending Node) (degrees)
- ω - Argument of Perigee (degrees)
- M - Mean Anomaly (degrees)
## Theoretical Background
The orbital mechanics theory and mathematical formulations implemented in this project are based on:
