# Orbital Propagation in LEO with J2 Perturbation
A Python implementation of orbital mechanics focusing on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite propagation with J2 perturbations due to Earth's oblateness.
## Overview
-Clasical Keplerian orbital propagation
-J2 perturbations
-Numerical integration
-Orbital trajectory visualization
## Orbital Elements
- a - Semi-major axis (km)
- e - Eccentricity
- i - Inclination (degrees)
- Ω - RAAN (Right Ascension of Ascending Node) (degrees)
- ω - Argument of Perigee (degrees)
- M - Mean Anomaly (degrees)
## Theoretical Background
The orbital mechanics theory and mathematical formulations implemented in this project are based on:
"Introduction to Orbital Mechanics" from Colorado Pressbook, available at : https://colorado.pressbooks.pub/introorbitalmechanics/
